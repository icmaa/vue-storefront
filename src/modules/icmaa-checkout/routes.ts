 * As we register this route dynamically using this module, it is important to consider the order of
 * module registration. For example: this module was registered after the `icmaa-google-tag-manager` module,
 * which leads into the problem that the `beforeEach` guard of the GTM module won't handle routing events of
 * the Ã¬cmaa-checkout` module as it was registered afterwards. So, keep that in mind.
