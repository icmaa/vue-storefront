 * As we register this route dynamically using this module, it is important to consider the order of

 * which leads into the problem that the `beforeEach` guard of the GTM module won't handle routing events of
 * the Ã¬cmaa-external-checkout` module as it was registered afterwards. So, keep that in mind.
